📌 About

I wish to take my career in the web development path within the full stack, a broad range of areas I'd like the flexibility of maintaining and building upon. This can include an ecompassing or concentrated role in the frontend, backend, and devops. I hope to expand my software and collaboration skills, working with talented and ambitious people to bring a high quality product to the marketplace.

📊 Activity

I started programming whilst pursuing a Mechanical Engineering degree with a strong exposure to software development in Carnegie Mellon University where I created a game project and used my experience for future endeavors. I transitioned my career to software development by working with Revature where I completed an intensive boot camp training in the Java full stack before getting hired by Wells Fargo to work maintaining their financial advisor platform. I further legitimized myself by working to complete a Computer Science degree at the University of Florida. I hope to continue honing my skills and expertise as a software developer in more enterprise scale applications within the full stack.
